<h3>Mangoes are widely used in cuisine. Sour, unripe mangoes are used in chutneys, athanu, pickles, side dishes, or may be eaten raw with salt, chili, or soy sauce. Mangoes are used to make murabba, muramba, amchur, and pickles, including a spicy mustard-oil pickle and alcohol.
Unripe mango may be eaten with bagoong, fish sauce, vinegar, soy sauce, or with dash of salt. Dried strips of sweet, ripe mango are also popular. Mangoes may be used to make juices, mango nectar, and as a flavoring and major ingredient in ice cream and sorbetes.
It is popular on a stick dipped in hot chili powder and salt or as a main ingredient in fresh fruit combinations. In Central America, mango is either eaten green mixed with salt, vinegar, black pepper, and hot sauce, or ripe in various forms.
In other parts of Southeast Asia, mangoes are pickled with fish sauce and rice vinegar. Green mangoes can be used in mango salad with fish sauce and dried shrimp. Mango with condensed milk may be used as a topping for shaved ice.<br /><i>Which is why we only serve mangoes at our establishment as mangoes are all you ever really need.</i></h3>
